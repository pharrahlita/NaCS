I began task 1 by replicating the diagram shown in step one. After this, I allocated IP addresses to the appropriate devices. Then, I ensured that both FastEthernet ports on the router were set to “on”. Finally, in order to test the network I used the ping command in the command prompt. The results of this, as well as the diagram itself are shown on the following page.


As shown in the screenshot below, the other devices connected to the same switch connected fine, however, I had a problem with the devices on the other side of the router. 



I thought that this problem was most likely due to the router not being properly configured; I hadn’t properly configured IP addresses for each ethernet port in the router. In order to solve this, I went into the router’s IP config settings and assigned appropriate IPv4 addresses and subnet masks.



However, this did not solve the problem. So, in order to troubleshoot the problem further, I decided to perform the tracert command in order to trace the route between PC0(192.168.1.1) and PC4(192.168.2.4), the results from this are below: 

From the information above, I determined that the problem was most likely due to  a problem with the Default Gateway within my network since the request failed at the first hop. To solve this, I checked the IP configuration window of all of my devices and noticed that the default gateway and DNS server had not been configured. After configuring all of these devices correctly, I performed another ping test and all devices worked correctly.
